# DigiByteMiner
1 Click Miner for Digibyte

# Important Update - February 2021
Please note that mining with a CPU/GPU with the One-Click Miner is currently not possible -  all 5x algorithms are mined with ASIC or FPGA machines at present, making CPU/GPU mining unviable. Even with free electricity it is not worth pursuing. DigiByte 8.21.x (coming soon) will introduce two new algorithms to make CPU and GPU mining possible again:
* RandomX, optimized for CPU mining, will likely replace SHA256
* ProgPOW, optimized for GPU mining, will likely replace Skein

## Features<To be edited and refined>
  
  * Standalone exe. Does not need an installer, packaging and has no dll dependencies.
  * Detects gpus in the system and uses appropriate miners for that gpu. Also provides options to switch between them.
  * Can run miners on both Amd and Nvidia at the same time.
  * Allows editing of the script for anything we cannot configure from ui.
  * Allows editing script even before miners are downloaded.
  * Allows only single instance of app. Minimizable to trey.
  * Detects system without gpus and handles with message.
  * Can switch between different Algorithms although Skein is the only profitable one currently. Future support for Equihash etc.
